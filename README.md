# Analysis of US unemployment Data of the last three recessions

# Overview: 
For this project we cleaned and extracted data from our data source using Jupiter Notebook. By doing this, it allowed us to compare unemployment rates to various contributors . Some old the categories we look at  were education, gender, race and ethnicity. We had access to 20 years worth of data but focused on our past recessions. 
### Importance:
The purpose of the project was to demonstrate our skills in order to analyze and better understand a data set. As a group we decided to explore data regarding unemployment. Our data provided a baseline to what factors contribute to the jobless rate in the US for the last 20 years. This will help identify gaps in the labor participation and how to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and the future of employees in the US labor force. 
### Problem Statement:
To predict the likelihood of unemployment during times of recession in the US based on oneâ€™s race and ethnicity, educational attainment across the groups, and the degree of discrimination of gender encountered in the workplace. 
# Program installation: 
###  Jupiter Notebook  and Python:
Jupiter notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share live code. It allows you to also share visualizations, equations and text. Some of its uses include data cleaning and viewing, transformations, and statistical modeling.  Jupiter supports Julia, Python, and R. 

A basic level of  knowledge of Jupyter notebook and Python was needed in order to complete this project. We did some basic things such as reading a csv. file, cleaning the file , making data frames, and using data frames to make graphs. 
### Installing Juypter notebook
There are different ways you can install Jupiter notebook, We can use either mamba or conda.

If you are unable to install Jupyter notebook :

Jupyter allows you to try Jupyter Notebook on your browser!
# Data Source:
For our dataset, we used the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data form each recession period within the last 20 years

# Findings: 
### Gender/Unemployment
### Race/Unemployment
### Education/Unemployment

# Other uses for the code:
While we did use our code to compare unemployment to other variables. Our code can be used to help other students compare other sets of data. It could serve as a base or template for other projects.
